<h2 id="january-23th-2014">January 23th 2014</h2>
<p>I have decided to start studing one of the old and famous courses of MIT <a href="http://bit.ly/1hBkxTi">SICP</a> which uses scheme as programming language and it took me some time to setup things and it would help someone or me in the future.</p>
<p>I used MIT-SCHEME as implementation of scheme: First we need to download <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/">binarys</a>, 
after that we need to move package to Applications folder and create links so i can just type scheme in terminal</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">sudo ln -s /Applications/MIT\:GNU\ Scheme.app/Contents/Resources /usr/local/lib/mit-scheme-x86-64
sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/mit-scheme-x86-64/mit-scheme /usr/bin/scheme
</code></pre>
<p>after that i wanted to execute scheme inside my sublime text so created new built system</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">{
  &quot;cmd&quot;: [&quot;scheme&quot;, &quot;--silent&quot;, &quot;--load&quot;, &quot;$file&quot;],
  &quot;file_regex&quot;: &quot;^[ ]*File \&quot;(...*?)\&quot;, line ([0-9]*)&quot;,
  &quot;selector&quot;: &quot;source.sch&quot;,
  &quot;path&quot;: &quot;/usr/bin&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>uhuu and everything is ready.</p>
